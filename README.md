# Covid-Facemask-Detection

I designed and implemented an end-to-end pipeline using various tools and techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in public areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. This involved creating a machine learning model using Python and industry-standard libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV to classify images as mask or non-mask.

To build a robust dataset, I collected and labeled thousands of images from various sources, including social media platforms, webcams, and security cameras. I used data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's accuracy.

I also implemented real-time detection using tools like Flask and Docker, allowing the system to identify individuals not wearing masks and alert authorities quickly. The plan was deployed on cloud computing services such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform to ensure scalability and efficiency.

I employed transfer learning techniques to improve the model's accuracy and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on a large dataset. This resulted in a highly accurate system, with a precision rate of 98% and a recall rate of 95%.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing skills to build a valuable tool that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The system can be deployed in public places, such as airports, hospitals, and schools, to ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines and protect public health.
